The Kubewarden team greatly appreciates investigative work into security
vulnerabilities carried out by well-intentioned, ethical security researchers.
We follow the practice of [responsible
disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) in order to
best protect Kubewarden's user-base from the impact of security issues. On our
side, this means:

- We will respond to security incidents on priority.
- We will release fixes for issues as soon as is practical, keeping in mind
  that not all risks are created equal.
- We will always transparently let the community know about any incident that
  affects them.

If you have found a security vulnerability in Kubewarden, the easiest way to
report a vulnerability is through the [Security tab on
GitHub](https://github.com/kubewarden/community/security/advisories). This
mechanism allows maintainers to communicate privately with you, and you do not
need to encrypt your messages.

Alternatively, you can can disclose it responsibly by emailing
[cncf-kubewarden-maintainers@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-kubewarden-maintainers@lists.cncf.io)
in an **unencrypted** message. Please do not discuss potential vulnerabilities in public without validating
with us first.

You can also come talk to us at our [slack-room] in the Kubernetes Slack server.

On receipt the security team will:

- Review the report, verify the vulnerability and respond with confirmation
  and/or further information requests.
- Once the reported security bug has been addressed we will notify the
  Researcher, who is then welcome to optionally disclose publicly.

Please, refer to the [community
repository](https://github.com/kubewarden/community) to find more about the
project Governance and Security Policy.
